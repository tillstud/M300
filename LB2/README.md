## Documentation
https://github.com/mc-b/M300/tree/master/vagrant/fwrp

### Idea
Create multiple machines and connect them together to create a Web portal where only members can write text, but that text is visible in read only mode to anybody visiting the Webpage.

For this I needed:
- Web service
- Database
- User and Rights distribution

### Overview
![A WebServer, ](/LB2/assets/architecture_diagram.xml)
- some visualization
- short description
### Test cases
- just a couple of cases
### Security
#### Firewall
#### Reverse-Proxy
#### User and Rights distribution
- LDAP
#### Access via SSH tunnel
### Reflection
- general mood reflection
- comparison prior vs increased knowledge
